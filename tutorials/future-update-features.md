# Inkflow 
Inkflow is a _really_ big project.

It is a cloud sourced community for Inkerion coding, and to communicate with other Inkerians.
You can have all of your projects saved. Wherever you are. Anytime.
You can collaborate. Achieve goals like you never have by yourself.
It's a place to socialize, cooperate, and achieve.
It's the future of Inkerion.
It's **_Inkflow_**.

**Inkflow is currently in production, and there is no set date for an open beta.**

# InkerionSquibs
This is for people who want to customize.
Squibs are free, open-sourced extension packets for Inkerion.
It's a way to get creative.

**Squibs is also avalible for a set alpha release in summer!**
